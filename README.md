Third Approach to 3rd Party Analytics: The third party analytics service I choose was Microsoft Clarity. The reason I choose this was due to the fact that they had many cool features such as seeing how many times someone rage clicks on your website or the heat tracking of how people move on your website. Some of the things I evaluated were the time spent, the pages visited, and the total time the user spent on my website. I also looked into rage clicks. When the user clicks on something really hard or continues to click on something it probably means that that part of your website isn't intuitive so we should look into bettering it. Overall, I think that Microsoft Clarity is the best analytics service that I have tried so far. This is due to the fact that it was so simple to set up(much easier than google analytics) and had the most information available to me without me adding other things. I think the heat feature and the rage click feature are very unique and bring a new perspective to how people use my website. It also has a recording feature that records all of the sessions, grouping them by user. This is what logrocket does but Microsoft Clarity has many more features added to this. Overall, I would use Microsoft Clarity again.
